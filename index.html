                    <h2>Synopsis</h2>
                    <p>The self-proclaimed mad scientist Rintarou Okabe rents out a room in a rickety old building in
                        Akihabara, where he indulges himself in his hobby of inventing prospective "future gadgets" with
                        fellow lab members: Mayuri Shiina, his air-headed childhood friend, and Hashida Itaru, a
                        perverted hacker nicknamed "Daru." The three pass the time by tinkering with their most
                        promising contraption yet, a machine dubbed the "Phone Microwave," which performs the strange
                        function of morphing bananas into piles of green gel.

                        Though miraculous in itself, the phenomenon doesn't provide anything concrete in Okabe's search
                        for a scientific breakthrough; that is, until the lab members are spurred into action by a
                        string of mysterious happenings before stumbling upon an unexpected success—the Phone Microwave
                        can send emails to the past, altering the flow of history.

                        Adapted from the critically acclaimed visual novel by 5pb. and Nitroplus, Steins;Gate takes
                        Okabe through the depths of scientific theory and practicality. Forced across the diverging
                        threads of past and present, Okabe must shoulder the burdens that come with holding the key to
                        the realm of time.</p>
